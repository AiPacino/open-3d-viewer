How to build the Android port of s3v
====================================

Customizing
-----------

This doesn't quite work yet; the model needs to be made configurable first.
Later, this section will describe how to get a custom model into the app, and
how to change the Google Analytics key.


Actually building
-----------------

0. Download Android SDK, NDK
1. In Eclipse, File->New->Project...->Android Project
2. Create project from existing source, s3v/android
3. Use the Android 3.0 SDK
4. Finish
5. Right-click project, Properties -> Java Build Path -> Libraries
   -> Add JARs... -> Add s3v/libs/libGoogleAnalytics.jar
6. cd jni && ndk-build  # To build the native bits
7. Build & Run in eclipse. s3v uses OpenGL ES 2.0, which the simulator doesn't
   support, so make sure to connect a physical device via USB


Releasing to the market
-----------------------

* Make sure that `BodyActivity.DEVELOPER_MODE` is `false`
* Make sure that `BodyActivity.ANALYTICS_ACCOUNT_ID` is correct
* Edit AndroidManifest.xml with your own `package=`, `android:versionCode=`,
  and `android:versionName=`
* Use your own icon.png in res/drawable-hdpi and res/drawable-mdpi
* Use your own res/drawable/body_copyright.png
